# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model
 Developing a prediction model to determine whether or not a passenger would survive on the titanic.
# Project description
The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic ocean on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg while on transit from Southampton to NYC. This shipwreck is considered one of the deadliest accidents in which more than 1,500 passengers died out of estimated 2,224 passengers and crew members aboard the ship. The incident has remained one of the most talked-about history points, with several movies and books being developed to narrate the story. 

This analysis aims to use available Titanic data to come up with a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not. Some of the features that will be trained in this model include the gender and age and the cabin where they were located. The analysis uses a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to build the prediction model.
# Technologies used
